Many false rumors and half-truths have been spread.  Newspaper articles, television shows and especially the internet have slandered the ICC, and yet, the facts are that lives have been radically changed, marriages have been healed, drug addicts have been freed, the poor have been fed and cared for, and this rapidly growing movement — The SoldOut Movement — is spreading around the world in this generation!
